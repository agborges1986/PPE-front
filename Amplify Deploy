Of course\! Here’s how you adapt those instructions for an application deployed with AWS Amplify.

The main difference is that with Amplify, you don't manually copy files into the `build` folder. Instead, you automate this step by editing Amplify's build settings so it fetches the `settings.js` file for you during its deployment pipeline.

Here is the step-by-step guide to make it work.

### The Overall Strategy 🗺️

1.  **Deploy Backend (CloudFormation):** This step remains the same. You need to create the backend resources first to generate your unique `settings.js` file.
2.  **Configure Amplify Frontend:** Instead of building your app locally and copying the file, you will configure your Amplify build process to:
      * Know the location of your S3 bucket (using an Environment Variable).
      * Run a command to download `settings.js` from that S3 bucket.
      * Place it in the correct folder (`public`) *before* the `npm run build` command runs.
      * Proceed with the normal build and deployment.

### Step-by-Step Guide ✅

#### 1\. Deploy the CloudFormation Stack (Same as your instructions)

Follow **Step 1** from your guide exactly. Launch the stack in your desired AWS region and wait for it to reach `CREATE_COMPLETE`.

After it's done, follow **Step 2** of your guide to find the S3 bucket name where `settings.js` is stored.

**➡️ Your action:**

  * Deploy the CloudFormation stack.
  * Go to the CloudFormation console -\> **Resources** tab.
  * Find the S3 bucket (`AWS::S3::Bucket`).
  * **Copy the bucket name**. It will look something like `ppedemo-stack-webappbucket-xxxxxxxxx`.

You do **not** need to download the file manually. You just need the bucket name.

#### 2\. Configure Your Amplify App

Now, go to your application in the AWS Amplify console.

##### A. Add an Environment Variable

Amplify needs to know which S3 bucket to pull the configuration from. You'll provide this as an environment variable.

1.  In your Amplify app, go to **Build settings** from the side menu.
2.  Scroll down to the **Environment variables** section and click **Edit**.
3.  Add a new variable:
      * **Variable:** `S3_CONFIG_BUCKET`
      * **Value:** Paste the S3 bucket name you copied in the previous step.
4.  Click **Save**.

##### B. Edit the Build Settings (`amplify.yml`)

This is the most important step. You'll add a command to the build process to download the file.

1.  Still in **Build settings**, scroll up to the **Build and test settings** section and click **Edit**.
2.  Select the **Amplify YAML editor**.
3.  Replace the contents with the following code. This script tells Amplify to download the file during the `preBuild` phase.

<!-- end list -->

```yaml
version: 1
frontend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
        # This command downloads settings.js from your S3 bucket
        # into the 'public' folder.
        - aws s3 cp s3://${S3_CONFIG_BUCKET}/settings.js public/settings.js
    build:
      commands:
        - npm ci
        - npm run build
  artifacts:
    baseDirectory: build
    files:
      - '**/*'
  cache:
    paths:
      - node_modules/**/*
```

**Why copy to the `public` folder?**
For React apps created with Create React App, any file in the `public` folder is automatically copied into the final `build` folder when you run `npm run build`. This is the perfect way to inject the file before your app is bundled for deployment.

4.  Click **Save**.

#### 3\. Deploy the Frontend 🚀

Now that everything is configured, you just need to trigger a new build in Amplify. The easiest way to do this is by pushing a small change to your connected Git repository.

`git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger Amplify build with new settings" && git push`

Amplify will detect the push, start a new build, and automatically:

1.  Read the `S3_CONFIG_BUCKET` environment variable.
2.  Run the `aws s3 cp` command to download your `settings.js`.
3.  Run `npm run build`, which will include the newly downloaded `settings.js`.
4.  Deploy the contents of the `build` folder.

Your application is now live and connected to its backend\!
